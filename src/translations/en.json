  "content": "World Care Mission: Environment,\nSocial Responsibility, and Good Governance (ESG)\n\nMaking a positive impact on the environment, social responsibility, and good governance (ESG) is not just a topic for discussion but an underlying consideration in all that we touch.\n\nZoul's mission is committed to making this happen here and now. We start by creating audio content that enhances awareness and fosters the implementation of sustainability, equality, and goodness, impacting the behaviors of millions of listeners worldwide.\n\nIn creating Zoul, we involve people of all nationalities, races, religions, and genders, thereby promoting equality of opportunity for all to be part of making this world a better place.\n\nWhile data quality, reliability, and greenwashing can pose challenges to the accurate measurement of ESG criteria, Zoul believes that ESG can be achieved through the world population’s strong mental health and wellness. Mental strength and wellness lead to non-discrimination and consideration of the human race as a whole. Every piece of Zoul content is built on the principle of gratitude, recognizing that everything we consume is derived from the earth and other human beings.\n\nThis profound gratitude can be cultivated through mindfulness, even in simple acts like drinking clean water and being thankful, recognizing how interconnected we all are.\n\nSeeing oneself as part of the whole, and the whole as part of oneself. Recognizing the sufferings of others as our own and the happiness of others as our family’s happiness.\n\nThat is how and where true ESG begins.\n\nNote: In practicing what we believe, Zoul stands behind the initiation of the global event of World Depression Care Day (WCD), making giving love, support, and care to others, bringing the world together, creating self-generating joy and sustainable long-lasting wellness for all our Zoul DNA.",
